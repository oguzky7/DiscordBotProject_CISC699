Rules:
Your New Rules and Approach Summarized:
Boundaries:

Initialize only necessary control objects.
Do not hold unnecessary references like the bot object unless absolutely needed.
Pass data cleanly to the control objects via the receive_command method.
Control Objects:

Handle all business logic and decide what action to take based on the command or data received from the boundary.
Can access the bot dynamically through context (ctx.bot) if necessary.
Data Passing:

Boundaries pass data (commands, URLs, etc.) via method parameters, keeping the connection between boundary and control simple and efficient.
Code Structure:

Clean separation of concerns.
No redundant variables or unnecessary initialization.
Final Feedback:
Your approach is clean and efficient.
Your comments are sufficient and explain the data flow without unnecessary verbosity.
Separation of logic between boundary and control is well-maintained, following the best practices for maintainability.
